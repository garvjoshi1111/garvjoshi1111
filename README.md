## Hi, I'm Garv Joshi 🍕

### A wannabe absurdist & an occasional human 🌟

🌐 **What I'm Up To:**
- 🧑‍💻 Writing code that's more confused than I am in a social setting
- 🚀 Attempting to launch my dignity into space. So far, just a lot of failed launches

🎓 **Currently Learning:**
- The subtle art of not rage quitting when my code decides to take a nap

👫 **Let's Team Up:**
- If you love debugging more than your own life decisions, we'll get along great!
- Looking for someone to share in the glory of fixing that bug at 3 AM

🔍 **Could Use a Hand With:**
- Finding where I misplaced my will to debug

📧 **Get In Touch:**
- DM for tech talks or if you want to debate pineapple on pizza 🍍🍕

🤖 **Me in Two Words:**
- Syntax/Error

**Note:** If my code breaks, it's just taking a dramatic pause for effect. Stick around for the encore!
